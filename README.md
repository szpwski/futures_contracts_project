# Futures contracts - distributions generators, modelling the claims process and options pricing
### Project prepared for Futures Contracts classes

This project is split into 4 parts. The first part is about generating pseudorandom numbers from uniform distribution by linear congruence. The second is about generating pseudorandom numbers from different distributions. Next, the third part contains information about modelling claims process using Poisson and Gamma distributions. Final, the last part refers to option pricing by Monte Carlo methods in association to Black-Scholes formula. Project is prepared in Polish and can be accessed by downloading the repository and opening *futures_contracts_main.html* file.
